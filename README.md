# trellis

The bounded-systems **contract map** — a semantic tree whose nodes are repos and
whose links are _actual specs_ — plus the one aggregating **flake check that CI
runs** to prove those links hold.

A trellis is the lattice a tree is trained onto; here each crossbar is a
contract between two repos.

## Why

The org's inter-repo contracts are real but scattered and unenforced. Three
things were true when trellis started:

- **Contracts aren't one kind.** Edges between repos fall into distinct kinds —
  capability wire surfaces, vendored flake-input pins, shared schemas,
  external-platform APIs, import/ambient-authority seams, repo-config
  conformance, provenance/signing. A single "does the daemon match its client?"
  frame missed most of them.
- **No repo owned the whole picture.** `seam-check` proves import boundaries;
  `dev-contracts` proves repo config; `ocap-provenance` is a shared schema — but
  nothing mapped the edges or checked them together.
- **The enforcement mechanism existed but never ran.** Each door daemon already
  had `checks.<sys>.*-mirror` derivations that `diff` vendored copies against
  pinned inputs — but no CI ran `nix flake check`, they were `aarch64-darwin`-
  scoped while CI is Linux, and they had **already drifted** (door-keeper's
  vendored client lagged door-kit by ~30 commits, missing whole methods its own
  daemon implements; `import-and-push` sends `ledgerRef` where keeperd reads
  `manifestDigest`, silently dropping data).

trellis maps every edge and makes the check actually run.

## The tree is decentralized and type-based

Each repo declares its **own** node — a `trellis.json` — in terms of the
contract **types** it provides and consumes, **never** by naming other repos:

```json
{
  "node": "door-keeper",
  "visibility": "public",
  "provides": [
    {
      "type": "keeper-wire",
      "kind": "wire",
      "spec": { "verbspec": "./specs/keeperd.ts" }
    }
  ],
  "consumes": [
    { "type": "guest-room-protocol" },
    { "type": "ocap-provenance-predicate" }
  ]
}
```

trellis **assembles** the tree by matching a provider of type `T` to every
consumer of type `T`. Rename or swap a repo and the type-links still resolve —
the map never hardcodes an edge.

**Coverage.** Every public org repo is a node: `bootstrap/catalog.json` is a
bulk list of all public repos (most with no edges yet), and a per-repo
`bootstrap/<repo>.trellis.json` overrides its catalog entry with the real
`provides`/`consumes` once mapped (to be upstreamed into each repo as a
`trellis.json`). So the tree is complete as a node set and grows edges
incrementally. The two **private** repos are deliberately absent — they belong
to a private sidecar (**`trellis-private`**, mirroring `.github` /
`.github-private`) that reuses the same schema + flake; nodes carry a
`visibility` field and assembly is visibility-aware. This public/private split
is itself a contract — one-way visibility (private ⇒ public, never the reverse)
— written up in
[`docs/public-private-contract.md`](docs/public-private-contract.md).

## Contract kinds

| kind                | governs                                       | leaf check                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `wire`              | daemon RPC / MCP tool / CLI surfaces          | VerbSpec schema conformance   |
| `vendored-pin`      | flake-input mirrors (door-kit, guest-room, …) | `*-mirror` diff derivation    |
| `shared-schema`     | ocap-provenance, machine-schema, …            | schema equivalence            |
| `external-platform` | GitHub / Slack / Notion APIs                  | (external)                    |
| `import-boundary`   | the "one sanctioned reader" seams             | `@bounded-systems/seam-check` |
| `repo-config`       | conformance, brand/token gates                | dev-contracts / actions       |
| `provenance`        | signing, attestation, lineage                 | verify / ocap-provenance      |

The flake check **wraps** these leaf mechanisms — it doesn't replace them. A
type moves from `declared` to `verified` when its leaf check is wired into the
flake.

## Usage

```sh
# what types exist, and which have a live check
deno run --allow-read verbs.ts types

# the assembled edges (provider→consumer), filterable
deno run --allow-read verbs.ts edges --kind wire
deno run --allow-read verbs.ts edges --type keeper-wire

# is a type actually checked?
deno run --allow-read verbs.ts verify --type keeper-wire
```

The verbs are VerbSpec projections (CLI now; MCP / OpenAPI for free), dogfooding
the same pattern trellis checks.

## The live edge: `keeper-wire`

One edge is wired end-to-end as proof: the `keeper-wire` contract between
**keeperd** (door-keeper, the provider) and its **in-box client** (door-kit, the
consumer).

- `specs/keeperd.ts` — the canonical surface, 8 VerbSpec verbs.
- `specs/keeper-wire.json` — projected from that spec by `deno task gen`; the
  dependency-free manifest the offline check reads (never hand-edited).
- `check/keeper-wire.ts` — parses keeperd's `METHODS` table and the client's
  `request(...)` calls and asserts both conform to the manifest (method set +
  `import-and-push` param names).
- `flake.nix` — pins `door-keeper` + `door-kit` as source inputs and exposes
  `checks.<system>.keeper-wire`, runnable offline (`--no-remote`) on Linux
  **and** darwin (so CI hits it _and_ a maintainer can run it locally).

```sh
nix flake check   # runs keeper-wire against the pinned source
```

Today this **fails on purpose** — it catches the real upstream drift
(`import-and-push` sends `ledgerRef`, not `manifestDigest`). That red is the
finding, not a trellis bug. CI runs it **report-only** (`continue-on-error`)
until the upstream fix lands; flip it to a blocking gate once
door-kit/door-keeper are corrected and the inputs are re-pinned.

## A second live edge: `door-kit-mirror` (a different kind)

`checks.<system>.door-kit-mirror` proves a **different contract kind**
(`vendored-pin`) with a **different mechanism** — a pure byte-`diff`, no deno —
showing the flake wraps heterogeneous leaf checks, not one tool. door-keeper
vendors door-kit's `lib/{keeper,runtime}.ts`; the check asserts those copies are
byte-identical to door-kit HEAD. It fails today because the vendored copy is
stale (the same drift as the door-keeper issue), catching it from the
pin-freshness angle rather than the wire angle. Generalizes the per-repo
`*-mirror` checks that existed but never ran in CI.

## A third live edge: `sanctioned-reader-seam` (a unary contract, and green)

`checks.<system>.sanctioned-reader-seam` **wraps the published
`@bounded-systems/seam-check`** — pinned as a flake input, its pure `seam.ts`
imported directly and run offline (no reimplementation, no JSR network). It
proves a **unary** contract: a "one sanctioned reader" package upholding its own
seam claim (allowed imports + no ambient authority) — no counterparty, so it's a
node invariant, not a provider→consumer edge. `specs/seams.json` holds each
claim; `fs`'s is `node:fs`/`node:path` only, and it **passes** — the first green
verified edge, proving the checks aren't always-red. `env`/`host`/`proc`/
`repo-root` are the next providers.

So contracts come in two shapes: **relational** (wire, vendored-pin —
provider↔consumer edges) and **unary** (import-boundary — a node upholding its
own invariant). trellis models both.

## Status

Three types are `verified` (live checks): `keeper-wire` (wire, red — drift),
`door-kit-mirror` (vendored-pin, red — drift), and `sanctioned-reader-seam`
(import-boundary, green — conforms). Every other type is `declared` — mapped and
honest that no check enforces it yet. Every public repo is a node; edges grow
one leaf check at a time (one flake input + one `checks.*` entry).
